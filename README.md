# STM-Configuration-Files
These files are necessary for the files generated by STCubeMX to compile correctly using visual studio code. 

# Usage

used to configure the compiler in visual studio code. 

# Configuration
On line four of c_cpp_properties.json be sure to change "Mac" to the correct label if using windows or linux systems. 
On line Seven be sure that the numbers following STM32F_XXX are all correct. Do not change the X's the should remain
untouched. Only replace whatever number is in the position of the _ symbol. Do the same process with the stm32f334x8.h
found in the same line.
